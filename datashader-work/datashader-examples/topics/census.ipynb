    "The 2010 Census collected a variety of demographic information for all the more than 300 million people in the USA.  Here we'll focus on the subset of the data selected by the Cooper Center, who produced a [map of the population density and the racial makeup of the USA](http://www.coopercenter.org/demographics/Racial-Dot-Map).  Each dot in this map corresponds to a specific person counted in the census, located approximately at their residence. (To protect privacy, the precise locations have been randomized at the census block level, so that the racial category can only be determined to within a rough geographic precision.) The Cooper Center website delivers pre-rendered tiles, which are fast to view but limited to the specific plotting choices they made.  Here we will show how to run novel analyses focusing on whatever aspects of the data that you select yourself, rendered dynamically as requested using the [datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader) library.\n",

If you have at least 16GB of RAM, you should be able to run this notebook-as is, using fast in-core operations.  If you have less memory, you'll need to use the slower out-of-core operations by commenting out the ``.persist()`` call."

    "(Histogram equalization also works for non-integer data, but in that case it will use a finite set of bins to divide the interval between the minimum and maximum values, and will thus not be able to normalize the histogram perfectly for highly non-uniform distributions.)  Effectively, this transformation converts the data from raw magnitudes, which can easily span a much greater range than the dynamic range visible to the eye, to a rank-order or percentile representation, which reveals density differences at all ranges but obscures the absolute magnitudes that were used to compute the ordering. In this representation, you can clearly see the effects of geography (rivers, coastlines, and mountains) on the population density, as well as history (denser near the longest-populated areas), and even infrastructure (with many small towns located at crossroads).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the very different results from the different types of plot, a good practice when visualizing any dataset with datashader is to look at both the linear and the histogram-equalized versions of the data; the linear version preserves the magnitudes, but obscures the distribution, while the histogram-equalized version reveals the distribution while preserving only the order of the magnitudes, not their actual values.  If both plots are similar, then the data is distributed nearly uniformly across the interval.  But much more commonly, the distribution will be highly nonlinear, and the linear plot will reveal only the envelope of the data, i.e., the lowest and the highest values.  In such cases, the histogram-equalized plot will reveal much more of the structure of the data, because it maps the local patterns in the data into perceptible color differences on the screen.\n",

Now that the data's been aggregated but not yet rendered to the screen, there is an infinite range of queries you can pose!"
