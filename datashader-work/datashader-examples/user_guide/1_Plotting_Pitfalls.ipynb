But as panel **A&nbsp;**shows, the shape of an **undersampled** distribution can be very difficult or impossible to make out, leading to incorrect conclusions about the distribution.  Such problems can occur even when taking very large numbers of samples, if examining sparsely populated regions of the space, which will approximate panel **A&nbsp;**for some plot settings and panel **C&nbsp;**for others.  The actual shape of the distribution is only visible if sufficient datapoints are available in that region *and* appropriate plot settings are used, as in **D,** but ensuring that both conditions are true is a quite difficult process of trial and error, making it very likely that important features of the dataset will be missed.\n",

Given the 256 gray levels available in a normal monitor (and the similarly limited human ability to detect differences in gray values), numerically mapping the data values into the visible range is not going to work well.  But given that we are already backing off from a direct numerical mapping in the above approaches for correcting undersaturation and for doing log transformations, what if we entirely abandon the numerical mapping approach, using the numbers only to form a partial ordering of the data values?  Such an approach would be a rank-order plot, preserving order and not magnitudes.  For 100 gray values, you can think of it as a percentile-based plot, with the lowest 1% of the data values mapping to the first visible gray value, the next 1% mapping to the next visible gray value, and so on to the top 1% of the data values mapping to the gray value 255 (black in this case).

    "At this point, one could also consider explicitly highlighting hotspots so that they cannot be overlooked.  In plots B and C above, the two highest-density pixels are mapped to the two darkest pixel colors, which can reveal problems with your monitor settings if they were adjusted to make dark text appear blacker.  Thus on those monitors, the highest values may not be  clearly distinguishable from each other or from nearby grey values, which is a possible downside to fully utilizing the dynamic range available.  But once the data is reliably and automatically mapped into a repeatable, reliable, fully utilized range for display, making explicit adjustments (e.g. based on wanting to make hotspots particularly clear) can be done in a principled way that doesn't depend on the actual data distribution (e.g. by just making the top few pixel values into a different color, or by stretching out those portions of the color map to show the extremes more safely across different monitors). Before getting into such specialized manipulations, there's a big pitfall to avoid first:\n",

    "Let's say you've managed avoid pitfalls 1-5 somehow.  However, there is one more problem waiting to catch you at the last stage, ruining all of your work eliminating the other issues: using a perceptually non-uniform colormap.  A heatmap requires a colormap before it can be visualized, i.e., a lookup table from a data value (typically a normalized magnitude in the range 0 to 1) to a pixel color.  The goal of a scientific visualization is to reveal the underlying properties of the data to your visual system, and to do so it is necessary to choose colors for each pixel that lead the viewer to perceive that data faithfully.  Unfortunately, most of the colormaps in common use in plotting programs are highly *non*uniform.  \n",
